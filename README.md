# XPAuth

XPAuth is an alternative to the commonly used plugin called AuthMe - now known as AuthMeReloaded.

XPAuth aims to provide the best possible experience for anarchy-based servers. 

Players may login knowing nobody will be able to impersonate them and will not be able to know their valuable base coordinates without logging in.

This plugin is no longer being worked on and has some bugs. Feel free to fork the plugin yourselves and make changes where they are needed.

# Disclaimer

XPAuth is derived originally from a plugin named SashaAuth which can be found here https://github.com/2F4Uof2b2t/SashaAuth/
